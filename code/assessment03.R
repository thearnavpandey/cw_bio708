# CO2 dataset -------------------------------------------------------------

## DATA DESCRIPTION #######################################################

# The CO2 dataset in R records how grass plants from two origins, Quebec and
# Mississippi, respond to varying CO₂ concentrations and temperature treatments.

head(CO2)

# Each plant is identified by the `Plant` factor, with `Type` indicating its origin
# and `Treatment` showing whether it was chilled or nonchilled. `conc` gives the
# ambient CO₂ concentration (mL/L), and `uptake` measures the rate of CO₂
# assimilation (µmol/m²/sec). 

## DATA DESCRIPTION END ###################################################

# Q1
# CO2 dataframe is a base dataframe. Convert this to a class `tibble`
# then assign to `df_co2`
df_co2 <- as_tibble(CO2)

# Q2
# Convert column names to lowercase and reassign to `df_co2`
colnames(df_co2) <- str_to_lower(colnames(df_co2))

# Q3
# Create scatter plots of CO₂ uptake versus ambient CO₂ concentration using `df_co2`.
# - The x-axis should represent ambient CO₂ concentration
# - The y-axis should represent CO₂ assimilation rate
# - Color the points by treatment.
# - Create separate panels for each plant type (Quebec vs Mississippi) and combine the plots.

# The df_co2 dataset contains the following variables:

# - ambient CO₂ concentration
# - treatment: chilled vs nonchilled
# - type: plant origin (Quebec vs Mississippi)
# 
# Develop suitable statistical models to examine:
#   
# - The main effect of ambient CO₂ concentration (conc)
# - The main effect of treatment
# - The interaction between concentration and treatment
# 
# Fit these models separately for each plant origin.

# Q5
# Based on the models fitted in Q4 for Quebec and Mississippi plants,
# describe how CO2 assimilation rate responded to ambient CO2
# concentration under different treatments (chilled vs non-chilled) 
# for each plant origin. Highlight the differences between Quebec and 
# Mississippi plants, and use the model results to support your answers.

# ENTER YOUR ANSWER HERE as COMMENT: 
# (no coding required for this question) 

#For Quebec originated plants, concentration of CO2 had a significant positive
#effect on the rate of CO2 assimilation (Estimate = 0.022 and Pr(>|t|) < 0.05).
#Treatment (chilled or unchilled) did not have significant effect on the rate 
#of CO2 assimilation (Pr(>|t|) = 0.852).
#Since the interactions between concentration and treatment is insignificant
#(Pr(>|t|= 0.852), concentration alone show higher positive effect on the CO2
# assimilation regardless of chilling or non-chilling treatments.
#
#
#For Mississippi originated plants, concentration of CO2 had a significant positive
#effect on the rate of CO2 assimilation (Estimate =  0.017 and Pr(>|t|) < 0.05).
#Treatment also had significant negative effect on the rate of CO2 assimilation 
#(Estimate = -5.91 and Pr(>|t|) =  0.0233). 
#Since the interactions between concentration and treatment is also significant
#(Estimate = -0.0097 and Pr(>|t|) = 0.0482) chilling when also increasing CO2 
#concentration will lead to less C02 assimilation compared non-chilled treatment.

# BCI dataset:
# The BCI dataset contains tree species abundance data from 50 1-hectare plots 
# on Barro Colorado Island (Panama). Each row represents a plot, and each 
# column represents a tree species. Entries are counts of individuals of each 
# species in that plot. This dataset is often used to study species richness, 
# community composition, and diversity patterns in tropical forests.

# The following code transforms the BCI dataset from wide to long format.

# the corresponding count.

# This dataset contains environmental variables for the 50 plots in the BCI dataset.
# Key columns include:
# - UTM.EW, UTM.NS: spatial coordinates of each plot
# - Precipitation: mean annual rainfall (mm)
# - Elevation: plot elevation (m)
# - Age.cat: categorical forest age class
# - Geology: underlying geological formation type
# - Habitat: dominant habitat type in the plot
# - Stream: indicates presence of streamside (riparian) habitat
# - EnvHet: environmental heterogeneity (Simpson diversity of habitat subcells)
# These variables help explain variation in species composition and abundance 
# across plots and allow exploration of species–environment relationships.
